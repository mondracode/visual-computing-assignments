The depth of field is affected by the focal length of the lens, the aperture of the lens, and the distance between the subject and the camera.

You have the flexibility to switch between three main light types: &amp;ldquo;Point Light&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Directional Light&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Ambient Light&amp;rdquo;. Each light type offers a distinct way to illuminate and accentuate objects in your scene.
A standout feature of our code is the ability to precisely control the position of the light source.</description></item><item><title>2. Linear Perspective</title><link>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/linear-perspective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/linear-perspective/</guid><description>Linear perspective # Introduction # Linear perspective is a visual illusion which objective is to create an illusion of depth on a flat surface. All parallel lines (orthogonals) in a painting or drawing using this system converge in a single vanishing point on the compositionâ€™s horizon line.

Parallax</title><link>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/parallax/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/parallax/</guid><description>Parallax # Parallax is one of the foundations of spatial perception, by moving our point of view changes the relative position of observable objects.
We perceive this every day, but it is a feature that is not taken into account because it is very familiar to our eyes, my example of approach is for example the transmilenio that goes along Avenida 30, in which through the window we can see the hills of Bogota in the distance, moving in a relatively slow way, with respect to how it is moving the facades of houses, buildings and other structures near this avenue.</description></item><item><title>4. A joint example of depth perception</title><link>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/joint-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mondracode.com/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/joint-example/</guid><description>Joint example of depth perception # Introduction # In this example we aim for a combined representation of the three visual illusions presented previously. Used correctly, the union of techniques of depth of field, linear perspective and parallax can lead to a very convincing 2D representation of a 3D space.
