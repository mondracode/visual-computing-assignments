**Don't rename the repo but leave it as 'visual-computing-assignments'**  
even so if you decided to rename the repo anyways, say to `newreponame`, don't forget to update all url references of the markdown and js file sources, to reflect that change, i.e., look within all [content folder](https://github.com/VisualComputing/visual-computing-assignments/tree/main/content) files for `visual-computing-assignments` occurrences and replace them by `newreponame`, which btw should easily be doable in any recent open source code editor, e.g., ðŸ”Ž in [kate](https://kate-editor.org/) or [vs-codium](https://vscodium.com/).
