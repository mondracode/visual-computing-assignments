**Paul Leteliel Moros Anacona** [github](https://github.com/pmoros)\
I'm a systems engineer student at the National University of Colombia, who is passionate about open source software, servers and infrastructure. From this course I hope I will be able to understand how 3D and other visual effects work in a 2D screen. I'm the proud owner of a cat named "Pako" and I love to read books.
