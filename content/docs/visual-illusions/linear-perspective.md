# **Linear perspective**

Linear perspective is a visual illusion which objective is to create an illusion of depth on a flat surface. All parallel lines (orthogonals) in a painting or drawing using this system converge in a single vanishing point on the compositionâ€™s horizon line.

## p5.js example

In this example we depict an observer moving on a road in the middle of a desert. In front of him, there's a tunnel and two shapes laying on each side of the road. By pressing the up and down arrows, the observer can move away or towards the tunnel.

The important part of this example comes when getting as far as possible from the tunnel. Because of the linear perspective effect, the tunnel, the wall and the road (which is composed of two parallel lines) all converge into a center line or horizon. This gives the observer the effect of depth and works as a visual illusion of moving inside a three-dimensional space.
