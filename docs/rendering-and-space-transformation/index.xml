You have the flexibility to switch between three main light types: &amp;ldquo;Point Light&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Directional Light&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Ambient Light&amp;rdquo;. Each light type offers a distinct way to illuminate and accentuate objects in your scene.
A standout feature of our code is the ability to precisely control the position of the light source.</description></item><item><title>2.

It involves tracing rays from a specific origin in a scene and determining the objects or surfaces they intersect with. Raycasting is widely used for various purposes, such as rendering &amp;ldquo;3D&amp;rdquo; graphics, implementing collision detection, and creating visual effects like reflections and shadows.
This method of 3D scene rendering is what made Wolfenstein 3D a technichal achievement fir graphics of its time.</description></item></channel></rss>
