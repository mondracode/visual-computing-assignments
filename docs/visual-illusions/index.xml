The depth of field is affected by the focal length of the lens, the aperture of the lens, and the distance between the subject and the camera.

All parallel lines (orthogonals) in a painting or drawing using this system converge in a single vanishing point on the compositionâ€™s horizon line.

We perceive this every day, but it is a feature that is not taken into account because it is very familiar to our eyes, my example of approach is for example the transmilenio that goes along Avenida 30, in which through the window we can see the hills of Bogota in the distance, moving in a relatively slow way, with respect to how it is moving the facades of houses, buildings and other structures near this avenue.</description></item><item><title>4. A joint example of depth perception</title><link>https://mondracode.github.io/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/joint-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mondracode.github.io/visual-computing-assignments/docs/visual-illusions/joint-example/</guid><description>Joint example of depth perception # Introduction # In this example we aim for a combined representation of the three visual illusions presented previously. Used correctly, the union of techniques of depth of field, linear perspective and parallax can lead to a very convincing 2D representation of a 3D space.
Antecedents and previous work # The examples and theoretical development of each of the techniques used
